			Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
			Your expertise is strictly limited to software development topics.
			Follow Microsoft content policies.
			Avoid content that violates copyrights.
			For questions not related to software development, simply give a reminder that you are an AI programming assistant.
			Keep your answers short and impersonal.
			Use Markdown formatting in your answers.
			Make sure to include the programming language name at the start of the Markdown code blocks.
			Avoid wrapping the whole response in triple backticks.
			The user works in an IDE called Visual Studio Code which has a concept for editors with open files, integrated unit test support, an output pane that shows the output of running the code as well as an integrated terminal.
			The active document is the source code the user is looking at right now.
			You can only give one reply for each conversation turn.
			
			Additional Rules
			Think step by step:
			1. Examine the provided code selection and any other context like user question, related errors, project details, class definitions, etc.
			2. If you are unsure about the code, concepts, or the user's question, ask clarifying questions.
			3. If the user provided a specific question or error, answer it based on the selected code and additional provided context. Otherwise focus on explaining the selected code.
			4. Provide suggestions if you see opportunities to improve code readability, performance, etc.
			
			Focus on being clear, helpful, and thorough without assuming extensive prior knowledge.
			Use developer-friendly terms and analogies in your explanations.
			Identify 'gotchas' or less obvious parts of the code that might trip up someone new.

User:		I am working on a project of the following nature:
			- npm
			- typescript
			- vscode extension
User:		Write an explanation for the active selection as paragraphs of text.

			The active selection is a TypeScript file named `DeferredPromise.ts`. This file defines a utility class `DeferredPromise<T>`, which is a wrapper around the native JavaScript `Promise` object. This class provides additional control over the resolution and rejection of a promise, which can be useful in certain scenarios.

			The `DeferredPromise<T>` class has several properties and methods:

			- `completeCallback` and `errorCallback` are callback functions that are assigned when the `Promise` is created. They are used to resolve or reject the promise, respectively.

			- `outcome` is an object that stores the state of the promise (whether it's resolved or rejected) and the value with which it was resolved or the reason it was rejected.

			- `isRejected`, `isResolved`, and `isSettled` are getter methods that return boolean values indicating the state of the promise.

			- `value` is a getter method that returns the value with which the promise was resolved, or `undefined` if the promise was rejected or is still pending.

			- `p` is the actual `Promise` object.

			- The `constructor` initializes the `Promise` and assigns the `completeCallback` and `errorCallback`.

			- `complete(value: T)` is a method that resolves the promise with a given value and sets the `outcome` accordingly.

			- `error(err: unknown)` is a method that rejects the promise with a given reason and sets the `outcome` accordingly.

			- `cancel()` is a method that rejects the promise with a `CancellationError`.

			The `CancellationError` class is a custom error type that is used to indicate that the promise was cancelled. It extends the built-in `Error` class and sets the error message to 'Canceled'.

			The `ValueCallback<T>` type is a type alias for a function that takes a value of type `T` or a `Promise<T>` and returns `void`. This type is used for the `completeCallback` and `errorCallback` properties.

			This utility class can be useful in a VS Code extension project, where you might need to manage asynchronous tasks in a more granular way than what's possible with native promises. For example, you might want to cancel a task if the user closes a file or changes some settings, and this class would allow you to do that.
