User:		I'm on MacOS and I have changed the case of a file name. When I commit it to git the file name has not changed in git. How can I fix this?
Assistant:		Git is case insensitive by default on some platforms like MacOS. You can change this behavior by setting the `ignorecase` flag to `false` in your git configuration. However, to solve your current issue, you can use the following steps:
			
			1. Rename the file using `git mv` with the `-f` option, which stands for "force". This will allow git to rename the file even if the only change is the case.
			
			Here is the command:
			
			```bash
			git mv -f OldFileName newfilename
			```
			
			2. Commit the changes
			
			```bash
			git commit -m "Renamed file"
			```
			
			3. Push the changes to the remote repository
			
			```bash
			git push
			```
			
			Remember to replace `OldFileName` and `newfilename` with your actual file names.

			The active selection is a TypeScript class named `DeferredPromise`. This class is a custom implementation of a Promise, which is a built-in JavaScript object used for asynchronous computations. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, resolved, or rejected. 

			The `DeferredPromise` class has several properties and methods:

			- `completeCallback` and `errorCallback` are functions that are set when the `DeferredPromise` is instantiated. They are used to resolve or reject the promise, respectively.

			- `outcome` is an object that stores the state of the promise (either resolved or rejected) and the value associated with that state.

			- `isRejected`, `isResolved`, and `isSettled` are getter methods that return boolean values indicating the state of the promise.

			- `value` is a getter method that returns the value of the promise if it has been resolved, or `undefined` if it hasn't.

			- `p` is the actual Promise object.

			- The `constructor` method creates a new Promise and assigns the `resolve` and `reject` functions to `completeCallback` and `errorCallback`, respectively.

			- The `complete` method resolves the promise with a given value.

			- The `error` method rejects the promise with a given error.

			- The `cancel` method rejects the promise with a `CancellationError`.

			The `CancellationError` class is a custom error type that extends the built-in JavaScript `Error` class. It's used to indicate that the promise was cancelled.

			The `ValueCallback` type is a function type that takes a value or a promise of a value and doesn't return anything. It's used for the `completeCallback` and `errorCallback` methods.

			This code is part of a Visual Studio Code extension, which is a plugin that adds new features or functionality to the Visual Studio Code editor. The `DeferredPromise` class could be used to handle asynchronous tasks in the extension, such as fetching data from an API or reading a file from disk.

User:		why does complete return a new promise?

			The `complete` method in the `DeferredPromise` class returns a new Promise to ensure that the completion of the deferred promise is handled asynchronously. This is a common pattern in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations.

			When you call `complete`, it resolves the `DeferredPromise` with a given value and then sets the `outcome` of the promise to `Resolved`. However, these operations are not instantaneous, especially if the value you're resolving the promise with is itself a promise or a thenable (an object with a `then` method).

			By returning a new Promise from `complete`, you ensure that the caller can wait for the `DeferredPromise` to be fully resolved before continuing. This is done by calling `then` on the promise returned by `complete`, like so:

			```typescript
			deferredPromise.complete(value).then(() => {
			  // The DeferredPromise is now fully resolved
			});
			```

			This pattern can help prevent race conditions and other timing-related bugs in asynchronous code.
